## Hi, my name is Daniel Duarte ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth-year Computer Engineering student at the Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de Costa Rica.

I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and programming languages, and I thrive on tackling challenging problems to find innovative solutions.

My particular interest lies in the **Internet of Things (IoT)**. I find it fascinating how entire systems can be automated by connecting physical devices. In fact, I'm currently designing a new IoT server that will be used in the laboratory where I'm working.
